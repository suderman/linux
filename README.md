Linux configuration and scripts
==============================

What's this?
------------

This is collection of scripts and configuration files that I might have
kept in my dotfiles, except they're specifically targeted at Ubuntu and
not really dotfiles. I have a similar repo for
[OS X](https://github.com/suderman/osx)

Installation
------------

If you're me, open a terminal and run this command:  
`git clone git@github.com:suderman/linux.git ~/.linux`  

And it might be a good idea to add `~/.linux/bin` to your path. Then run
the new `linux` command to install my [dotfiles](https://github.com/suderman/dotfiles) 
and my favourite apps. 

Or just let it be installed automatically by opening a terminal on 
a server and running this command:  

`curl https://raw.github.com/suderman/linux/master/install | sh`
